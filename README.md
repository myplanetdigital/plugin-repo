plugin-repo
===========
This repository was created for sharing copies of publicly available libraries,
modules and plugins. The goal is to prevent a situation where required inks to 
plugins are broken, and version of plugin is unknown. Additionally, this will
allow us to maintain version control of the plugins.


If you need a module that doesn't exist, you should add it yourself.

    clone the repo. 
    choose a category for your (plugin/library/module), 
    go to dir with this category
    create subdir with the name of this module
    then create dir with version and put your file there
    after this commit and push the changes.


Don't forget to add human-readable comment for your commit.

Example: libraries / jquery / jquery.ui.selectmenu / 1.2.0 / selectmenu_v1.2.0.tar.gz

which creates a link like this: https://github.com/myplanetdigital/plugin-repo/raw/develop/libraries/jquery/jquery.ui.selectmenu/1.2.0/selectmenu_v1.2.0.tar.gz
